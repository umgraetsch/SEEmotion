I used Google's Cloud Vision API Text Recognition, but the results were unreliable. Out of 30 high-contrast 1280 x 1024 bmp images, only a handful resulted in the correct output, or at least included the correct output in the results. The program tends to omit some numbers, output in non-English languages or sneak in a few special characters.The goal is to at least output the correct numbers consecutively, doesn't matter if the results are sprinkled with other junk. Is there a way to help the program recognize numbers better, for example limit the results to a specific format, or to numbers only?"""

I know the Google Vision demo is pretty CPU intensive, but when I try a simpler version of it (i.e. without grabbing every frame all the time and handing it to the detector) I'm not getting reliable barcode reads.(I am running a Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini on KitKat 4.4.3 Unfortunately, for reasons known only to Samsung, they no longer report the OnCameraFocused event, so it is impossible to know if the camera grabbed the focus and call the barcode read then. That makes grabbing and checking every frame seem like the only viable solution.)So to at least prove the concept, I wanted to simply modify the Google Vision Demo. (Found)It seems the easiest thing to do is simply jump in the code and add a media recorder. I did this in the CameraSourcePreview method during surface create.Like this:That DOES record things, while still handing each frame off to the Vision code. But, strangely, when I do that, the camera does not seem to call autofocus correctly, and the barcodes are not scanned -- since they are never really in focus, and therefore not recognized.My next thought was to simply capture the frames as the barcode detector is handling the frames, and save them to the disk one by one (I can mux them together later.)I did this in CameraSource.java.This does not seem to be capturing all of the frames, even though I am writing them out in a separate AsyncTask running in the background, which I thought would get them eventually -- even if it took awhile to catch up. The saving was not optimized, but it looks as though it is dropping frames throughout, not just at the end.To add this code, I tried putting it in the     private class FrameProcessingRunnable in the run() method.Right after the FrameBuilder Code, I added this:Which calls this class:I'm OK with the mediarecorder idea, or the brute force frame capture idea, but neither seem to be working correctly."""

Assuming broader terms have more connections to other terms than more refined terms. I foundthat discusses the amount of ""edges"" a MID has which I believe means the number of connections. However, they do some converting between MID values to Long Values and use various scripts that keep giving me numerous errors in Python. I was hoping for a simple table with MID values in one column and the number of connections in another but I'm lost in their code, converting values, and Python Errors.If you have any suggestions for easily determining the amount of connections a MID has or its hierarchical level, it would be greatly appreciated.

In the spirit of hacking through this, that's what I did to get it mostly working*.

From searching on the error, I considered it might be an HTTPS thing, so I've even tried a variation on this where I replaced HTTPS with HTTP but got the same error.Using:This code always returns. On a suggestion, it was believed that the method shouldn't be passed the base64 image, but instead the public path; which would explain why it says the name is too long (a base64 image is quite the URL). Unfortunately, that gives the PEM error from above. I've also tried not doing the base64 encoding and pass the object buffer directly from aws but that resulted in a PEM error too.According to, the image should be base64 encoded.From the API docs and examples and whatever else, it seems that I'm using these correctly.

These images aren't more than 1MB.*The PEM error seems to be related to credentials, and because my understanding of how all these credentials work and how the modules are being compiled on EC2 (which doesn't have any kind of PEM files), that might be my problem. Maybe I need to set up some credentials before running, kind of in the same vein as needing to be installed on a linux box?

For example if my camera reads ""How you?"" then I would find in my database a entry that is similar ""How are you?"" and would display this instead. So the real problem is that the OCR is constantly reading from the camera, so that means that I would need to make an HTTP request to a server and query the database for a similar match every second or two and wait for the response, that could be very bad execution if there are many users overloading the server. One solution that I thought was downloading the list of all strings in the database and make the matching locally, but what if the data changes after that in the database?

Cloud Vision was a tad faster but the time it took to compress more than outweighed the improvement. How can I improve response time? I'll list some ideas.1) Since we're sending a URL to Google Cloud, it takes time for Google Cloud to receive a response, that is from the img_src, before it can even analyze the image. Is it faster to send a base64 encoded image? What's the fastest form in which to send (or really, for Google to receive) an image?2) My current code for label detection. First question: is it faster to send a JSON request rather than call Ruby (label or web) methods on a Google Cloud Project? If so, should I limit responses? Labels with less than a 0.6 confidence score don't seem of much help. Would that speed up image rec/processing time?Open to any suggestions on how to speed up response time from Cloud Vision."""

To do this I started by downloading watson-developer-cloud and I put it in my node_modules folder, which is next to my index.html and api_request.js.This is my api_request.js file:It is taken directly from the visual recognition api documentation. I ran this file in the terminal and it provided the desired output which is a list of visual recognition classifiers. However as it has node.js functions I decided to use browserify to allow it to run in the browser. I installed browserify and built bundle.js out of api_request.js in the same directory as the api_request.js and index.html file.Once index.html was linked to bundle.js I opened it in the browser and it didn't have any issues with node.js functions.However an error occurred when a file that was in watson-developer-cloud couldn't find another file that was inside watson-developer-cloud. To be specific index.js couldn't find v2-beta (I didn't edit the watson-developer-cloud files). What I find strange is that when I ran api_request.js in the terminal none of the watson-developer-cloud files had any problems, but once I used browserify, bundle.js logged the error that index.js couldn't find v2-beta.^that is the script I used to build bundle.js. The only thing I can think could be causing this error is browserify. Is there something else that could be causing this?"""
